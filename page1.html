        <h1>The Life Chapters of Sean Owen Refolledo</h1>

        <h3>By: Sean Owen A. Refolledo</h3>

        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Sean Owen A. Refolledo and it all started in the busy streets of Manila.
            I currently live at 1936 Almeda St. Tondo, Manila.
            This specific environment played a huge role in who I am today.
            My childhood was so much fun because life was simple.
            Life was honestly so simple during my entire childhood.
            I spent most of my days playing outside with my friends.
            These were my friends from my very own neighborhood.
            We used to play traditional Filipino games such as <i>patintero</i> on the streets.
            <b>Luksong baka</b> was also one of our absolute favorites.
            We used to play until we were sweaty and tired.
            Aside from active games, we also loved simple picnics with one another.
            We did this almost on a daily basis together.
            We enjoyed sharing whatever food we had at that time.
            For my education, I was in Andres Bonifacio Elementary School.
            I was in there for my years from Kinder to Grade 6.
            It was in that school where I met new people.
            I eventually became close friends with many of them.
            Every time there were no classes, I would go to their houses.
            Graduation eventually came for all of us students.
            Looking back, these years were the basis of my social life.

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>
            When I was growing into my teens things started to change.
            However, the fun never stopped for me.
            I went to Cayetano Arellano High School for my secondary education.
            I started my classes there in Grade 7.
            I stayed there until I finished Grade 12.
            My routine was not very different than elementary school.
            I was still hanging out with my childhood friends.
            However, there was a new interest that came into my life.
            I started playing computer games during this time.
            I eventually found my way into online gaming.
            I became addicted to the game <b>Dota 2</b>.
            This was because it was so popular and competitive.
            It got to the point where I was playing it everyday.
            Instead of looking at the clock, I would often forget the time.
            After school, I would go straight down to the computer shop.
            Despite the gaming addiction, I ensured that I complete my studies.
            When I got to Senior High School, I had to pick a track.
            I chose to take the TVL track with a specialization in EIM.
            This strand focused a lot on electrical installation.
            These friends from Senior High are my friends till college.

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <p>
            Now, I am living the difficult but exciting life in college.
            I am currently studying in the University of the East (UE).
            I decided to change my interest from electrical works.
            I shifted my focus to the field of technology.
            I took the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (IT) program.
            It was a big adjustment from my EIM days.
            However, I was up for the challenge.
            On my first year as a college student, I was nervous.
            I was worried about meeting new people.
            Fortunately, I was able to meet a group of students.
            They were very approachable and kind to me.
            We immediately clicked as a group.
            We quickly became a solid group of friends.
            I am happy to say that I am still friends with them.
            We wanted to make our college life easy.
            We made a contract about when we schedule our work.
            We decided to be classmates during all enrollments.
            This strategy has served us well from freshman year.
            Having a support system is very important in IT.
            My journey from Tondo to UE has been a long ride.
