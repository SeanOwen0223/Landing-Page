            Tilt Proof: How League of legends Taught me Patience in College

        <h2>
            How did it start?
        </h2>
        <p>I would be that guy who could not get an entire week out of a bad grade. <strong>I was sensitive, anguished
                and could be easily annoyed by life</strong>. Then <strong>I began to apply the reasoning of play on a
                high level League to my real life</strong>. I thought to myself: Why do I allow it to stress me out this
            way when I survived worse in Solo Queue? Viewing my challenges in college as a high stakes game, I came to
            understand how to be more patient and discover a certain discipline that I was previously unaware of. I am a
            monster that cannot be stressed today, and it is completely thanks to the things that I have learned on the
            Rift.</p>

            <strong>The lesson that I got was that League of Legends is a vicious and unhealthy environment</strong>. I
            have witnessed it million times: a single argument about a missed Smite or lost lane that makes one of my
            teammates choose to destroy my day. We refer to it in the community as running it down, that is when a
            teammate intentionally feeds the enemy, intentionally leaks team positions in all-chat, or simply goes AFK
            just to be a pain in the neck to the team. <strong> have tilted me at the initial stages; I would have lost
                my temper and focus</strong>. However, with time, I also discovered that since I had the ability to
            remain calm when a stranger was actively working to frustrate my achievements then I could manage any form
            of negativity that college life could give me. At this point, I am not losing my head when a group project
            partner goes missing, or I receive immediate feedback of a brutal kind when I am, on the one hand, given by
            a professor. I have learned the good discipline of not listening to all that noise and remain calm when
            faced with sabotage. I have not only learned how to play a game, I have turned into a machine without
            stress.

            Late game
        </h2>
        <p>
            I will be frank even nowadays: I never managed to learn how to control my emotions to the latter. Sometimes
            there are days when a bad match in life pierces my armor, and I experience the old painful feeling of
            frustration. However, now the difference is that I am aware of how to deal with it. I am able to take myself
            in, take a breath and rediscover my cool. A patch note is daily in my personal development; I am constantly
            adjusting my way of thinking and teaching myself to be more confident in myself.

            <strong>I'm still human, of course. Laziness sets in or the urge to do the easy thing is at times too strong
                to resist</strong>. But, as I did during my four year trip along the Rift, I understand that progress is
            not a smooth path. I am still grinding, still practicing and still improving. It is my hope that someday I
            will stop being tilted by the distractions of life. In the meantime, I will continue to line up and be
            focused and keep in mind that as long as I do not give up, I have already won.
