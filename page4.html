            The High Stakes of a Shifting Meta
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Being a second-year student of BSIT</strong>, my late-night coding assignmets are frequently
            interrupted by a gnarkly idea which gets into my mind: <strong>Could a machine do it as well as I
                can?</strong> The graduation line seems to be shifting as far as it is with the blistering pace of Large
            Language Models and automated development tools. It is not just about the <strong>AI replacing the
                jobs</strong>; the entry level bar was really high to the extent that a degree may not even pass it. In
            the case of us who are still pursuing our studies, we always have the feeling that we are in a rat-race with
            some form of technology that seems to change every week.

            The Self-Study Pivot: Why I am Not Merely Following the Syllabus
        </h2>
        <p>
            I knew at an early age that I am basically educating myself to be a redundancy as long as I am just learning
            what is being put across in the classroom. I have resorted to self-study in order to remain tilt-proof in
            this new job market. Although <strong>university offers the necessary reasoning behind data structures and
                networking</strong>, I use my free time to <strong>understand how to organize these systems as well as
                AI tools.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I am educating myself on how to treat AI as a trainee of high level, but not as a
                replacement</strong>. Through reading, I am establishing a position within myself as an architect of
            solutions—not a syntax writer. It is an advantage to understand what to create and how to debug the
            intricate hallucinations that a machine can create in a world where any person can create code on command.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Redefining the Career Path
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>The employment landscape that I will enter in two years</strong> will be no similar to the one that
            was there during my freshman year. Nevertheless, I had a lesson that the patch to the career of an IT
            student lies in the ultimate adaptation. I am not going to compete with AI in terms of raw speed or
            efficiency but rather on the aspects that it cannot do well: critical thinking, complex project management,
            and an ability to comprehend human needs. I am no longer a student, I am a bootstrapper on my own, ready to
            live in a hybrid world.

        <h2>
            The Grind Continues
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Will it be harder to find a job? Perhaps. But hard is not impossible</strong>. My experience in the
            Rift revealed to me that you do not give up on the game because the meta is changing, but you modify your
            build. I continue to grind, continue practicing, and continue to improve my own patch notes. As long as I
            continue learning quicker than the models do, I will have a home in the industry.

        <h2>
            My Post-AI Market Approach
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Aggressive Self-Study:</b> Learning libraries and frameworks beyond the normal school curriculum.
            </li>
            <li><b>Human-centric Logic:</b> Focusing more on system design and structure than simple syntax.</li>
            <li><b>Integrating AI:</b> Learning how I can utilize AI as a force multiplier to be more productive.</li>
            <li><b>Constant Change:</b> The ability to view my skillset as a work-in-progress which needs a daily
                update.</li>
        </ul>
